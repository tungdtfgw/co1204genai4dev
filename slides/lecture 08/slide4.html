                    <strong>Autonomy</strong><br>
                    Agents operate independently without the need for direct human intervention. They make their own decisions and take actions, such as a self-driving car navigating traffic.

                <li class="slide-in-center" style="animation-delay: 0.2s;">
                    <strong>Continuous Learning</strong><br>
                    Agents improve their performance by learning from their environment and feedback. This allows them to adapt to changes, like a customer service chatbot learning from interactions.
                </li>
                
                <li class="slide-in-center" style="animation-delay: 0.4s;">
                    <strong>Goal-Oriented Behavior</strong><br>
                    Agents are designed to achieve specific objectives. They plan and execute actions to reach their goals, such as a trading bot maximizing portfolio returns.
                </li>
                
                <li class="slide-in-center" style="animation-delay: 0.6s;">
                    <strong>Environmental Interaction</strong><br>
                    Agents can perceive and respond to their environment through sensors and actuators, enabling them to operate in real-world scenarios.
