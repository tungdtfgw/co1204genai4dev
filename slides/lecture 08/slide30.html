                    <strong>A User asks "What's the weather like?"</strong><br>
                    1. The input is sent to the homework_guardrail. 2. The guardrail_agent analyzes the input and its HomeworkOutput is {is_homework: false, reasoning: "This is a general knowledge question, not related to academics."}.

                    <strong>The Tripwire is Triggered</strong><br>
                    3. The homework_guardrail function sees that is_homework is False. 4. It sets tripwire_triggered=True, which immediately stops the process and raises an InputGuardrailTripwireTriggered exception.

                    <strong>Process Termination</strong><br>
                    5. The exception is caught and handled. 6. The user receives a message explaining that the request was blocked because it's not related to homework or academic topics.

                    <strong>Security and Control</strong><br>
                    7. The system maintains its security and control by preventing inappropriate or off-topic requests from being processed. 8. This ensures that the system only handles requests that align with its intended purpose.
