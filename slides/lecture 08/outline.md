#### It achieves this by designing its own operational sequence and leveraging available tools.

---

## Slide 6 More Industry Perspectives on AI Agents
### Amazon's Definition
#### An AI Agent is a software program that interacts with its environment, using data to perform self-directed tasks.
#### While humans set the goals, the agent independently chooses the best actions to achieve them.

### FPT IS's Definition
#### An AI Agent can perceive its environment, receive feedback, and take appropriate action.
#### It can also solve complex problems by planning and executing actions using its equipped toolset.

### VNPT AI's Definition
#### An AI Agent is designed to automate and perform specific tasks independently.
#### It can perceive its surroundings, reason based on collected data, and act to achieve set objectives.

---

## Slide 7 Core Components of an AI Agent
### The Model (The Brain)
#### The model is the central component for planning, predicting, and selecting actions.
#### It is typically a Large Language Model (LLM) with capabilities for reasoning, planning, and tool selection.

### The Tools (The Hands)
#### Tools extend the agent's capabilities, allowing it to interact with external data and services.
#### This includes **Function Calling**, where the LLM decides when to use a function, and **Data Store augmentation** (like RAG) to overcome static knowledge limitations.

### The Orchestration Layer
#### This layer manages how the agent receives information and reasons about its next actions.
#### It controls the flow of planning, execution, and determining the subsequent steps.

---

## Slide 8 Key Characteristics of AI Agents
### Autonomy
#### Agents operate independently without the need for direct human intervention.
#### They make their own decisions and take actions, such as a self-driving car navigating traffic.

### Continuous Learning
#### Agents improve their performance by learning from their environment and feedback.
#### This allows them to adapt to changes, like a customer service chatbot learning from interactions.

### Reactive and Proactive Behavior
#### Agents not only react to changes but can also anticipate future events and act preemptively.
#### An example is the Nest Thermostat, which learns user preferences to proactively adjust the temperature.

---

## Slide 9 How AI Agents Work: The Operating Loop
### A Continuous Cycle of Action
#### AI Agents operate in a continuous loop to achieve their goals.
#### The process begins with a user-defined objective.
#### The agent then gathers information, creates a plan, executes tasks, and evaluates the outcome, repeating as necessary.

---

## Slide 10 The Agent's Operating Loop in Detail
### Step 1: Define Objectives
#### The agent receives a high-level command from the user.
#### It then breaks down the main goal into smaller, more specific, and actionable tasks.

### Step 2: Gather Information
#### The agent retrieves data from various sources like the internet, databases, or its own interaction history.
#### This information is processed to create the necessary context for planning.

### Step 3: Create a Plan
#### The agent develops a step-by-step roadmap to achieve the objective.
#### It uses its core LLM and reasoning techniques like ReAct, Chain of Thought (CoT), or Tree of Thoughts (ToT).

### Step 4 & 5: Execute and Evaluate
#### The agent executes each step of the plan, continuously evaluating its effectiveness based on feedback.
#### It self-corrects and adjusts the plan as needed based on the results of its actions.

---

## Slide 24 Introduction to the A2A Protocol
### A Universal Language for AI Agents
#### The Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol is a groundbreaking framework developed by Google, announced in April 2025.
#### Its main goal is to solve the lack of interoperability between AI agents built with different frameworks, APIs, and tools.
#### A2A aims to create a "common language" that allows different AI agents to communicate and collaborate.

---

## Slide 25 Core Concepts of the A2A Protocol
### Agent Card
#### This is the AI agent's "business card" in JSON format.
#### It advertises the agent's capabilities, how to communicate with it (endpoints, authentication), and supported features like streaming.

### A2A Server & Client
#### The **A2A Server** is the agent that listens for and executes tasks.
#### The **A2A Client** is any program or another agent that needs a task to be completed.

### Task
#### A task is the unit of work transferred between agents.
#### It has a lifecycle (submitted, in-progress, completed, failed) and can be either short or long-running.

---

## Slide 26 A2A Communication: Messages & Artifacts
### Messages for Continuous Dialogue
#### Messages carry the content of an ongoing conversation between agents.
#### They can include instructions, status updates, or intermediate "thoughts" of the agent.

### Artifacts for Final Results
#### Once a task is complete, the result is sent as an "artifact."
#### An artifact is an immutable result, such as a file or structured data.

### Parts for Detailed Content
#### Both messages and artifacts are composed of one or more "parts."
#### Each part is a piece of granular content with a defined type, such as text or an image.

---

## Slide 27 Advanced A2A Features
### Multi-modal Support
#### A2A allows agents to interpret and process multiple data types simultaneously, including text, images, and audio.
### Advanced Security Features
#### The protocol is designed with security in mind, with plans for quantum-resistant encryption and dynamic trust scoring.
### Capability Discovery
#### Agents can automatically advertise their skills via their Agent Card, helping other agents find the right partner for a task.
### User Experience Negotiation
#### Agents can negotiate message formats and content verbosity to best suit the end-user's interface.

---

## Slide 28 A2A and MCP: A Complementary Relationship
### Understanding MCP (Model Context Protocol)
#### Introduced by Anthropic, MCP focuses on connecting a single AI model to external tools and data in a standardized way.
#### In short, MCP connects an AI to its tools.

### How They Work Together
#### A2A and MCP are complementary, not competing, protocols.
#### A2A handles high-level coordination between autonomous agents.
#### MCP handles the low-level, standardized interaction between a single agent and a specific tool it needs to use.
#### Together, they form a robust, modular foundation for building intelligent, collaborative systems.

---

## Slide 29 The Future with A2A
### Solving the "Multi-Agent Hairball Problem"
#### A2A aims to simplify the complexity of getting many different agents to work together.
#### It provides a unified standard, allowing developers to plug in agents as easily as using microservices.

### Specialized Agent Collaboration
#### Instead of one "do-it-all" agent, A2A enables a future of specialized agents.
#### For example, a specialized programming agent could collaborate with a specialized reporting agent to complete a complex task.

### Current Status
#### A2A is a very new, open-source protocol that is still in a draft phase.
#### Google has released a GitHub repository with specifications and sample implementations for community discussion.

---

## Slide 30 Conclusion
### A Transformative Step in AI
#### AI Agents represent a major advancement, promising to profoundly change how we work and interact with technology.

-----

## Slide 31 Introduction to OpenAI Agents

### A Framework for Multi-Agent Systems

#### The OpenAI Agents library is a Python framework designed for creating and coordinating multiple AI agents.

#### It simplifies the process of building complex workflows where different agents collaborate to solve a problem.

### Core Idea: Orchestration and Specialization

#### The library allows you to create specialized agents, each with a unique purpose or expertise.

#### A primary "triage" or "router" agent can then intelligently delegate tasks to the appropriate specialist.

-----

## Slide 32 Why Use the Agents Framework?

### Structured Agent Collaboration

#### It provides clear patterns for agent handoffs, ensuring tasks are routed to the correct specialist.

#### This modular approach makes complex systems easier to design, build, and maintain.

### Built-in Security with Guardrails

#### The framework includes a "Guardrail" system to filter and validate user inputs before they are processed.

#### This adds a crucial layer of security and control, ensuring agents only work on appropriate tasks.

### Asynchronous by Design

#### The library is built with Python's `asyncio`, making it efficient for I/O-bound tasks.

#### This is ideal for applications that involve waiting for API responses from multiple agents.

-----

## Slide 33 Key Concepts of the Framework

### The `Agent`

#### An `Agent` is the fundamental building block, representing an AI with a specific purpose.

#### It is defined by a `name` and a set of `instructions` (its system prompt).

### The `Runner`

#### The `Runner` is responsible for executing an agent with a given input.

#### It manages the interaction with the OpenAI API and returns the agent's final output.

### `Handoffs`

#### This mechanism allows one agent (like a triage agent) to delegate a task to another specialized agent.

#### The triage agent uses the `handoff_description` of other agents to decide where to route the query.

### `Guardrails`

#### A `Guardrail` is a function that intercepts and validates user input *before* an agent processes it.

#### It can block requests that don't meet specific criteria, like a security checkpoint.

-----

## Slide 34 A Simple First Agent: `hello_agent.py`

### Goal

#### This script demonstrates the most basic functionality: creating and running a single agent.

#### The agent is given a specific personality ("a Lục Bát poet") and a simple task.

### Key Components

#### **`Agent`**: A single agent is created with a `name` and `instructions`.

#### **`Runner.run_sync`**: The synchronous runner is used to execute the agent with a user's question.

### Outcome

#### The agent receives the question "1 + 1 = ?" and, following its instructions, responds with a Lục Bát poem instead of the mathematical answer.

-----

## Slide 35 `hello_agent.py`: Code Overview

### Agent Initialization

#### An `Agent` object is created. The `instructions` parameter is the system prompt that defines its behavior.

### Running the Agent

#### The `Runner.run_sync` method takes the agent and the user's input as arguments.

#### It handles the API call to OpenAI and waits for the response.

### Displaying the Output

#### The result object contains the agent's final response in the `final_output` attribute.

### Code

```python
# hello_agent.py
from agents import Agent, Runner
import os

# Function to get API key from a file
def get_key():
    with open('keys.txt') as f:
        key = f.readline().strip().split(':')[-1]
    return key

# Set the environment variable for the library
os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = get_key()

# Create a new agent with a specific persona
agent = Agent(name="Nhà thơ", 
              instructions="Luôn luôn trả lời câu hỏi của người dùng bằng một bài thơ lục bát")
              # "Always answer the user's question with a Lục Bát poem"

# Run the agent synchronously with a question
question = '1 + 1 = ?'
result = Runner.run_sync(agent, question)
print(result.final_output)
```

-----

## Slide 36 Advanced Example: `demo_agent.py`

### Goal

#### To build a multi-agent "Homework Tutoring System".

#### The system will first verify that a question is about homework and then route it to the correct subject-matter expert (Math or History).

### Key Components

#### **`guardrail_agent`**: A specialized agent that acts as a security filter.

#### **`triage_agent`**: The main router that decides which tutor should handle the question.

#### **Specialist Agents**: `math_tutor_agent` and `history_tutor_agent`.

#### **`Runner.run`**: The asynchronous runner to handle the entire workflow.

-----

## Slide 37 `demo_agent.py`: The Guardrail (Part 1)

### Defining the Security Filter

#### The first step is to create an agent whose only job is to check if the input is valid.

#### We define a Pydantic `HomeworkOutput` model to force the agent to return structured JSON.

### The Guardrail Agent

#### The `guardrail_agent` is instructed to check if the user is asking about homework.

#### Its `output_type` is set to our `HomeworkOutput` class, ensuring a predictable `is_homework` boolean and a `reasoning` string.

### Code

```python
# demo_agent.py
from pydantic import BaseModel

# Define the structured output for the guardrail
class HomeworkOutput(BaseModel):
    is_homework: bool
    reasoning: str

# Create the agent that will perform the check
guardrail_agent = Agent(
    name="Guardrail check",
    instructions="Check if the user is asking about homework.",
    output_type=HomeworkOutput,
)
```

-----

## Slide 38 `demo_agent.py`: The Guardrail (Part 2)

### Implementing the Guardrail Function

#### The `homework_guardrail` function is the core of the input validation logic.

#### This `async` function is what the `triage_agent` will call before processing any input.

### The Tripwire Logic

#### Inside the function, we run the `guardrail_agent` on the user's input.

#### The function returns a `GuardrailFunctionOutput` object.

#### The `tripwire_triggered` flag is set to `True` if the input should be **blocked**. In our case, we block if `is_homework` is `False`.

### Code

```python
# demo_agent.py
from agents import GuardrailFunctionOutput, Runner

async def homework_guardrail(ctx, _agent, input_data):
    # Run the guardrail agent to analyze the input
    result = await Runner.run(guardrail_agent, input_data, context=ctx.context)
    
    # Extract the structured output
    final_output = result.final_output_as(HomeworkOutput)
    
    # Trigger the tripwire (block the request) if it is NOT homework
    return GuardrailFunctionOutput(
        output_info=final_output,
        tripwire_triggered=not final_output.is_homework,
    )
```

-----

## Slide 39 `demo_agent.py`: The Specialist Tutors

### Creating Expert Agents

#### We create two specialized agents: one for Math and one for History.

#### Each agent is given a unique `name` and a set of `instructions` tailored to its expertise.

### The `handoff_description`

#### This special parameter is crucial for the triage agent.

#### It provides a concise description of what the specialist agent does, which the triage agent uses to make its routing decision.

### Code

```python
# demo_agent.py

math_tutor_agent = Agent(
    name="Math Tutor",
    handoff_description="Specialist agent for math questions",
    instructions="You provide help with math problems. Explain your reasoning...",
)

history_tutor_agent = Agent(
    name="History Tutor", 
    handoff_description="Specialist agent for historical questions",
    instructions="You provide assistance with historical queries. Explain...",
)
```

-----

## Slide 40 `demo_agent.py`: The Triage Agent

### The Central Orchestrator

#### The `triage_agent` is the entry point for all user queries.

#### Its main job is not to answer questions itself, but to decide which other agent is best suited for the task.

### Connecting the Components

#### **`handoffs`**: This is a list of the specialist agents (`math_tutor_agent`, `history_tutor_agent`) that the triage agent can delegate tasks to.

#### **`input_guardrails`**: This connects our `homework_guardrail` function, ensuring every query is checked before the triage process begins.

### Code

```python
# demo_agent.py
from agents import InputGuardrail

triage_agent = Agent(
    name="Triage Agent",
    instructions="You determine which agent to use based on the user's homework question",
    handoffs=[history_tutor_agent, math_tutor_agent],
    input_guardrails=[
        InputGuardrail(guardrail_function=homework_guardrail),
    ],
)
```

-----

## Slide 41 `demo_agent.py`: The Main Execution Flow

### Handling the User's Question

#### The `handle_homework_question` function encapsulates the core logic.

#### It calls `Runner.run` with the main `triage_agent` and the user's question.

### Handling the Guardrail Exception

#### The `try...except` block is essential.

#### If the guardrail's "tripwire" is triggered (i.e., the question is not homework), the framework raises an `InputGuardrailTripwireTriggered` exception.

#### Our code catches this exception and provides a user-friendly message explaining why the request was blocked.

### Code

```python
# demo_agent.py
from agents.exceptions import InputGuardrailTripwireTriggered

async def handle_homework_question(question):
    try:
        # Run the entire multi-agent system starting with the triage agent
        print("Processing your question...")
        result = await Runner.run(triage_agent, question)
        
        # If successful, print the final output from the specialist agent
        print("Here's your answer:")
        print(result.final_output)
        
    except InputGuardrailTripwireTriggered as e:
        # This block executes if the guardrail blocked the question
        print("I can't help with that question.")
        print("Reason: This doesn't appear to be a homework question.")
```

-----

## Slide 42 `demo_agent.py`: The Interactive Loop

### Creating a Conversation

#### The `main` function creates an interactive command-line interface.

#### It prints a welcome message and enters a `while True` loop to continuously accept user input.

### Asynchronous Execution

#### The entire main function is `async` because our agent interactions (API calls) are asynchronous.

#### The `asyncio.run(main())` call at the end is the standard way to start an `async` program in Python.

### Code

```python
# demo_agent.py
import asyncio

async def main():
    print_welcome_message()
    
    while True:
        # Prompt user for input
        user_question = input(">>> ").strip()
        
        if is_exit_command(user_question):
            break
        
        # Call the async function to process the question
        await handle_homework_question(user_question)

# Entry point to start the async program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

-----

## Slide 43 How the Full System Works

### A User asks "What was the Magna Carta?"

#### 1\. The input is first sent to the `homework_guardrail`.

#### 2\. The `guardrail_agent` determines this is a homework question, so the guardrail allows it to pass.

### The Triage Agent Makes a Decision

#### 3\. The `triage_agent` now receives the question.

#### 4\. It analyzes the question and compares it to the `handoff_description` of its specialist agents. It decides the "History Tutor" is the best match.

### The Specialist Agent Responds

#### 5\. The task is handed off to the `history_tutor_agent`.

#### 6\. The history tutor follows its instructions to provide a clear explanation and returns the final answer to the user.

-----

## Slide 44 What Happens When the Guardrail Blocks?

### A User asks "What's the weather like?"

#### 1\. The input is sent to the `homework_guardrail`.

#### 2\. The `guardrail_agent` analyzes the input and its `HomeworkOutput` is `{is_homework: false, reasoning: "This is a general knowledge question, not related to academics."}`.

### The Tripwire is Triggered

#### 3\. The `homework_guardrail` function sees that `is_homework` is `False`.

#### 4\. It sets `tripwire_triggered=True`, which immediately stops the process and raises an `InputGuardrailTripwireTriggered` exception.

### The User Gets a Custom Message

#### 5\. The `except` block in `handle_homework_question` catches the exception.

#### 6\. It prints the friendly, pre-defined message explaining that it can only help with homework.

-----

## Slide 45 Conclusion
