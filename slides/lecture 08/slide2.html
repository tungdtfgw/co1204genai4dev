                            <strong>Core Definition:</strong> AI agents are software systems that use AI to pursue goals and complete tasks on behalf of users. They show reasoning, planning, and memory and have a level of autonomy to make decisions, learn, and adapt.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Multimodal Capabilities:</strong> Their capabilities are made possible in large part by the multimodal capacity of generative AI and AI foundation models. AI agents can process multimodal information like text, voice, video, audio, code, and more simultaneously.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Advanced Functions:</strong> They can converse, reason, learn, and make decisions. They can learn over time and facilitate transactions and business processes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Collaboration:</strong> Agents can work with other agents to coordinate and perform more complex workflows.
