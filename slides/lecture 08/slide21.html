                    <strong>Structured Agent Collaboration</strong><br>
                    It provides clear patterns for agent handoffs, ensuring tasks are routed to the correct specialist. This modular approach makes complex systems easier to design, build, and maintain.

                <li class="slide-in-center" style="animation-delay: 0.2s;">
                    <strong>Built-in Security with Guardrails</strong><br>
                    The framework includes a "Guardrail" system to filter and validate user inputs before they are processed. This adds a crucial layer of security and control, ensuring agents only work on appropriate tasks.
                </li>
                
                <li class="slide-in-center" style="animation-delay: 0.4s;">
                    <strong>Asynchronous Design</strong><br>
                    The framework is built with asyncio, allowing agents to work concurrently and efficiently handle multiple tasks simultaneously.
                </li>
                
                <li class="slide-in-center" style="animation-delay: 0.6s;">
                    <strong>Easy Integration</strong><br>
                    It integrates seamlessly with existing Python applications and can be easily extended with custom functionality.
                </li>
                
                <li class="slide-in-center" style="animation-delay: 0.8s;">
                    <strong>Scalability</strong><br>
                    The framework is designed to scale from simple single-agent systems to complex multi-agent workflows.
