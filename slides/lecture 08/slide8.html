                    <strong>Customer Service</strong><br>
                    The company Cosentino developed a "digital employee" that replaced the work of 3-4 human staff. This allows human employees to focus on higher-value, more strategic tasks.

                    <strong>Software Development</strong><br>
                    AI Agents can manage the entire software lifecycle, from architecture design to coding and quality monitoring. Meta's Mark Zuckerberg believes AI can perform the work of a mid-level engineer this year. Salesforce will not hire additional software engineers in 2025 due to productivity gains from AI agents.

                    <strong>Quality Assurance</strong><br>
                    AI agents can automatically test software, identify bugs, and ensure code quality throughout the development process.
