                    <strong>Agent Card</strong><br>
                    This is the AI agent's "business card" in JSON format. It advertises the agent's capabilities, how to communicate with it (endpoints, authentication), and supported features like streaming.

                    <strong>A2A Server & Client</strong><br>
                    The A2A Server is the agent that listens for and executes tasks. The A2A Client is any program or another agent that needs a task to be completed.

                    <strong>Task</strong><br>
                    A task is a specific request that the client wants the server to perform. It includes the task description, parameters, and any required context.
                </li>

                    <strong>Messages</strong><br>
                    Messages are the communication units between agents, containing task requests, responses, and status updates.
                </li>
                
                <li class="slide-in-center" style="animation-delay: 0.8s;">
                    <strong>Artifacts</strong><br>
                    Artifacts are the outputs or results produced by agents, such as files, data, or reports that can be shared between agents.
