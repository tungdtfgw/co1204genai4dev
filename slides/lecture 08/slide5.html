                    <strong>Step 1: Define Objectives</strong><br>
                    The agent receives a high-level command from the user. It then breaks down the main goal into smaller, more specific, and actionable tasks.

                <li class="slide-in-center" style="animation-delay: 0.2s;">
                    <strong>Step 2: Gather Information</strong><br>
                    The agent retrieves data from various sources like the internet, databases, or its own interaction history. This information is processed to create the necessary context for planning.
                </li>
                
                <li class="slide-in-center" style="animation-delay: 0.4s;">
                    <strong>Step 3: Create a Plan</strong><br>
                    Based on the gathered information, the agent develops a strategy to achieve its objectives. This includes selecting appropriate tools and determining the sequence of actions.
                </li>
                
                <li class="slide-in-center" style="animation-delay: 0.6s;">
                    <strong>Step 4: Execute Tasks</strong><br>
                    The agent carries out the planned actions using its available tools. This may involve making API calls, processing data, or interacting with external systems.
                </li>
                
                <li class="slide-in-center" style="animation-delay: 0.8s;">
                    <strong>Step 5: Evaluate and Iterate</strong><br>
                    After execution, the agent evaluates the results against its objectives. If the goal is not fully achieved, it adjusts its approach and repeats the cycle.
