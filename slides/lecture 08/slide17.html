                            <strong>Understanding MCP (Model Context Protocol):</strong> Introduced by Anthropic, MCP focuses on connecting a single AI model to external tools and data in a standardized way. In short, MCP connects an AI to its tools.

                            <strong>How They Work Together:</strong> A2A and MCP are complementary, not competing, protocols. A2A handles high-level coordination between autonomous agents. MCP handles the low-level, standardized interaction between a single agent and a specific tool it needs to use.

                            <strong>Different Levels of Abstraction:</strong> A2A operates at the agent-to-agent level, while MCP operates at the agent-to-tool level, providing different layers of functionality.

                        <li>
                            <strong>Synergistic Benefits:</strong> The combination of A2A and MCP enables complex multi-agent systems where agents can both collaborate with each other and interact with various tools and data sources.
