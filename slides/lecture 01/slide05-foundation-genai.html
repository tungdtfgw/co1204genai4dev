                            Neural Networks: Inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, consisting of layers of neurons (nodes) connected to each other, with each connection having a weight. Information is transmitted through layers, processed and transformed to produce the desired output. In Gen AI, neural networks act as the brain to learn patterns and generate new content.

                            Deep Learning: A subset of Machine Learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks) to learn complex data representations. Deep Learning allows models to automatically extract features from raw data, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering.
